There arenâ€™t many platforms available to give the LGBTQIA+ community a voice in a place free of judgment and with the ability to stay anonymous.

## User Story:
As A person belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community
I WANT a place where I can speak freely and receive support and/or advice

THEN I can choose a category from the dropdown menu
